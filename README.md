# RSVP Application in Elixir

This app is a example app from the PluralSight course `Getting Started with Phoenix` by `Nate Taylor`

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/phoenix-getting-started/table-of-contents

The course was first made available back in 2016 and a lot has changed in both Elixir and the Phoenix Framework. 

I have made an attempt to make the app compatible with the latest version of Elixir (1.8) and Phoenix (1.4.3).
